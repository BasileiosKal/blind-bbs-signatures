.# Abstract

This document defines an extension to the BBS Signature scheme that supports blind digital signatures, i.e., signatures over messages not known to the Signer.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

The BBS digital signature scheme, as defined in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures], can be extended to support blind signatures functionality. In a blind signatures setting, the user (called the Prover in the context of the BBS scheme) will request a signature on a list of messages, without revealing those messages to the Signer (who can optionally also include messages of their choosing to the signature).

By allowing the Prover to acquire a valid signature over messages not known to the Signer, blind signatures address some limitations of their plain digital signature counterparts. In the BBS scheme, knowledge of a valid signature allows generation of BBS proofs. As a result, a signature compromise (by an eavesdropper, a phishing attack, a leakage of the Signer's logs etc.,) can lead to impersonation of the Prover by malicious actors (especially in cases involving "long-lived" signatures, as in digital credentials applications etc.,). Using Blind BBS Signatures on the other hand, the Prover can commit to a secret message (for example, a private key) before issuance, guaranteeing that no one will be able to generate a valid proof without knowledge of their secret.

Furthermore, applications like Privacy Pass ([@I-D.ietf-privacypass-protocol]) may require a signature to be "scoped" to a specific audience or session (as to require "fresh" signatures for different sessions etc.,). However, simply sending an audience or session identifier to the Signer (to be included in the signature), will compromise the privacy guarantees that these applications try to enforce. Using blind signing, the Prover will be able to require signatures bound to those values, without having to reveal them to the Signer.

The presented protocol, compared to the scheme defined in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures], introduces an additional communication step between the Prover and the Signer. The Prover will start by constructing a "hiding" commitment to the messages they want to get a signature on (i.e., a commitment which reveals no information about the committed values), together with a proof of correctness of that commitment. They will send the (commitment, proof) pair to the Signer, who, upon receiving the pair, will attempt to verify the commitment's proof of correctness. If successful, they will use it in generating a BBS signature over the messages committed by the Prover, including their own messages if any.

This document, in addition to defining the operation for creating and verifying a commitment, also details a core signature generation operation, different from the one presented in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures], meant to handle the computation of the blind signature. The document will also define a new BBS Interface, which is needed to handle the different inputs, i.e., messages committed by the Prover or chosen by the Signer etc... The signature verification and proof generation core cryptographic operations however, will work as described in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]. To further facilitate deployment, both the exposed interface as well as the core cryptographic operation of proof verification will be the same as the one detailed in [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

Below is a basic diagram describing the main entities involved in the scheme.

# Scheme Definition

## Commitment Operations

### Commitment Computation

This operation is used by the Prover to create a `commitment` to a set of messages (`committed_messages`), that they intend to include in the blind signature. Note that this operation returns both the serialized combination of the commitment and its proof of correctness (`commitment_with_proof`), as well as the random scalar used to blind the commitment (`secret_prover_blind`).

```
(commitment_with_proof, secret_prover_blind) = commit(
                                                   committed_messages,
                                                   api_id)

Inputs:

- committed_messages (OPTIONAL), a vector of octet strings. If not
                                 supplied it defaults to the empty
                                 array ("()").
- api_id (OPTIONAL), octet string. If not supplied it defaults to the
                     empty octet string ("").

Outputs:

- (commitment_with_proof, secret_prover_blind), a tuple comprising from
                                                an octet string and a
                                                random scalar in that
                                                order.

Procedure:

1. committed_message_scalars = BBS.messages_to_scalars(
                                             committed_messages, api_id)

2. blind_generators = BBS.create_generators(
                                  length(committed_message_scalars) + 1,
                                  "BLIND_" || api_id)

3. return CoreCommit(committed_message_scalars,
                             blind_generators, api_id)
```

###  Commitment Validation and Deserialization

The following is a helper operation used by the `BlindSign` procedure ((#blind-signature-generation)) to validate an optional commitment. If a `commitment` is not supplied, or if it is the `Identity_G1`, the following operation will return the `Identity_G1` as the "default" commitment point, which will be ignored by all computations during `BlindSign`.

```
commit = deserialize_and_validate_commit(commitment_with_proof,
                                               blind_generators, api_id)

Inputs:

- commitment_with_proof (OPTIONAL), octet string. If it is not supplied
                                    it defaults to the empty octet
                                    string ("").
- blind_generators (OPTIONAL), vector of points of G1. If it is not
                               supplied it defaults to the empty set
                               ("()").
- api_id (OPTIONAL), octet string. If not supplied it defaults to the
                     empty octet string ("").

Outputs:

- commit, a point of G1; or INVALID.

Procedure:

1. if commitment_with_proof is the empty string (""), return Identity_G1

2. com_res = octets_to_commitment_with_proof(commitment_with_proof)
3. if com_res is INVALID, return INVALID

4. (commit, commit_proof) = com_res
5. if length(commit_proof[1]) + 1 != length(blind_generators),
                                                          return INVALID

6. validation_res = CoreCommitVerify(commit, commit_proof,
                                               blind_generators, api_id)
7. if validation_res is INVALID, return INVALID
8. commitment
```

## Blind BBS Signatures Interface

The following section defines a BBS Interface for blind BBS signatures. The identifier of the Interface is defined as `ciphersuite_id || BLIND_H2G_HM2S_`, where `ciphersuite_id` the unique identifier of the BBS ciphersuite used, as is defined in [Section 6](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-03.html#name-ciphersuites) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]). Each BBS Interface MUST define operations to map the input messages to scalar values and to create the generator set, required by the core operations. The input messages to the defined Interface will be mapped to scalars using the `messages_to_scalars` operation defined in [Section 4.1.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-messages-to-scalars) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures]. The generators will be created using the `create_generators` operation defined in [Section 4.1.1](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-generators-calculation) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

Other than the `BlindSign` operation defined in (#blind-signature-generation), which uses the `FinalizeBlindSign` procedure, defined in (#finalize-blind-sign), all other interface operations defined in this section use the core operations defined in [Section 3.6](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-core-operations) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

### Blind Signature Generation

This operation returns a BBS blind signature from a secret key (SK), over a `header`, a set of `messages` and optionally a commitment value (see (#terminology)). If supplied, the commitment value must be accompanied by its proof of correctness (`commitment_with_proof`, as outputted by the `Commit` operation defined in (#commitment-computation)).

The `BlindSign` operation makes use of the `FinalizeBlindSign` procedure defined in (#finalize-blind-sign) and the `B_calculate` procedure defined in (#calculate-b-value). The `B_calculate` is defined to return an array of elements, to establish extendability of the scheme by allowing the `B_calculate` operation to return more elements than just the point to be signed.

```
blind_signature = BlindSign(SK, PK, commitment_with_proof, header,
                                                               messages)

Inputs:

- SK (REQUIRED), a secret key in the form outputted by the KeyGen
                 operation.
- PK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by SkToPk
                 provided the above SK as input.
- commitment_with_proof (OPTIONAL), an octet string, representing a
                                    serialized commitment and
                                    commitment_proof, as the first
                                    element outputted by the Commit
                                    operation. If not supplied, it
                                    defaults to the empty string ("").
- header (OPTIONAL), an octet string containing context and application
                     specific information. If not supplied, it defaults
                     to an empty string ("").
- messages (OPTIONAL), a vector of octet strings. If not supplied, it
                       defaults to the empty array ("()").

Parameters:

- api_id, the octet string ciphersuite_id || "BLIND_H2G_HM2S_", where
          ciphersuite_id is defined by the ciphersuite and
          "BLIND_H2G_HM2S_"is an ASCII string composed of 15 bytes.
- (octet_point_length, octet_scalar_length), defined by the ciphersuite.

Outputs:

- blind_signature, a blind signature encoded as an octet string; or
                   INVALID.


Deserialization:

1. L = length(messages)

// calculate the number of blind generators used by the commitment,
// if any.
2. M = length(commitment_with_proof)
3. if M != 0, M = M - octet_point_length - octet_scalar_length
4. M = M / octet_scalar_length
5. if M < 0, return INVALID

Procedure:

1.  generators = BBS.create_generators(L + 1, api_id)
2.  blind_generators = BBS.create_generators(M, "BLIND_" || api_id)

3.  commit = deserialize_and_validate_commit(commitment_with_proof,
                                               blind_generators, api_id)
4.  if commit is INVALID, return INVALID

5.  (msg_1, ..., msg_L) = BBS.messages_to_scalars(messages, api_id)

6.  res = B_calculate(generators, commit, messages)
7.  if res is INVALID, return INVALID
8.  (B) = res

9.  blind_sig = FinalizeBlindSign(SK,
                                  PK,
                                  B,
                                  generators,
                                  blind_generators,
                                  header,
                                  api_id)
10. if blind_sig is INVALID, return INVALID
11. return blind_sig
```

### Blind Signature Verification

This operation validates a blind BBS signature (`signature`), given the Signer's public key (`PK`), a header (`header`), a set of, known to the Signer, messages (`messages`) and if used, a set of committed messages (`committed_messages`) and the `secret_prover_blind` as returned by the `Commit` operation ((#commitment-computation)).

This operation makes use of the `CoreVerify` operation as defined in [Section 3.6.2](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-coreverify) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

```
result = Verify(PK, signature, header, messages, committed_messages,
                                                    secret_prover_blind)

Inputs:

- PK (REQUIRED), an octet string of the form outputted by the SkToPk
                 operation.

### Proof Generation

This operation creates a BBS proof, which is a zero-knowledge, proof-of-knowledge, of a BBS signature, while optionally disclosing any subset of the signed messages. Note that in contrast to the `ProofGen` operation of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] (see [Section 3.5.3](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html#name-proof-generation-proofgen)), the `ProofGen` operation defined in this section accepts 2 different lists of messages and disclosed indexes, one for the messages known to the Signer (`messages`) and the corresponding disclosed indexes (`disclosed_indexes`) and one for the messages committed by the Prover (`committed_messages`) and the corresponding disclosed indexes (`disclosed_commitment_indexes`).

Furthermore, the operation also expects the `secret_prover_blind` (as returned from the `Commit` operation defined in (#commitment-computation)) value. If the BBS signature is generated using a commitment value, then the `secret_prover_blind` returned by the `Commit` operation used to generate the commitment should be provided to the `ProofGen` operation (otherwise the resulting proof will be invalid).

This operation makes use of the `CoreProofGen` operation as defined in [Section 3.6.3](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-coreproofgen) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

### Proof Verification

The ProofVerify operation validates a BBS proof, given the Signer's public key (PK), a header and presentation header values, two arrays of disclosed messages (the ones known to the Signer and the ones committed by the prover) and two corresponding arrays of indexes those messages had in the original vectors of signed messages. In addition, the `BlindProofVerify` operation defined in this section accepts the integer `L`, representing the total number of signed messages known by the Signer.

This operation makes use of the `CoreProofVerify` operation as defined in [Section 3.6.4](https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures.html#name-coreproofverify) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures].

1.  commit_len_floor = octet_point_length + 2 * octet_scalar_length
2.  if length(commitment_octs) < commit_len_floor, return INVALID

3.  C_octets = commitment_octs[0..(octet_point_length - 1)]
4.  C = octets_to_point_g1(C_octets)
5.  if C is INVALID, return INVALID
6.  if C == Identity_G1, return INVALID

7.  j = 0
8.  index = octet_point_length
9.  while index < length(commitment_octs):
10.     end_index = index + octet_scalar_length - 1
11.     s_j = OS2IP(commitment_octets[index..end_index])
12.     if s_j = 0 or if s_j >= r, return INVALID
13.     index += octet_scalar_length
14.     j += 1

15. if index != length(commitment_octs), return INVALID
16. if j < 2, return INVALID
17. msg_commitment = ()
18. if j >= 3, set msg_commitment = (s_2, ..., s_(j-1))
19. return (C, (s_0, msg_commitments, s_j))

# Security Considerations

Security considerations detailed in [Section 6](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-security-considerations) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] apply to this draft as well.

## Prover Blind Factor

The random scalar value `secret_prover_blind` calculated and returned by the `Commit` operation is responsible for "hiding" the committed messages (otherwise, in many practical applications, the Signer may be able to retrieve them). Furthermore, it guarantees that the entity generating the BBS proof (see `BlindProofGen` defined in (#proof-generation)) has knowledge of that factor. As a result, the `secret_prover_blind` MUST remain private by the Prover and it MUST be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator. See [Section 6.7](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures-05.html#name-randomness-requirements) of [@!I-D.irtf-cfrg-bbs-signatures] on recommendations and requirements for implementing the `BBS.get_random_scalars` operation (which is used to calculate the `secret_prover_blind` value).

## Key Binding

One natural use case for the blind signatures extension of the BBS scheme is key binding. In the context of BBS Signatures, key binding guarantees that only entities in control of a specific private key can compute BBS proofs. This can be achieved by committing to the private key prior to issuance, resulting in a BBS signature that includes that key as one of the signed messages. Creating a BBS proof from that signature will then require knowledge of that key (similar to any signed message). The Prover MUST NOT disclose that key as part of a proof generation procedure. Note also that the `secret_prover_blind` value returned by the `Commit` operation defined in (#commitment-computation) (see (#prover-blind-factor)), has a similar property, i.e., it's knowledge is required to generate a proof from a blind signature. Many applications however, requiring key binding, mandate that the same private key is used among multiple signatures, whereas the `secret_prover_blind` is uniquely generated for each blind signature issuance request. In those cases, a commitment to a private key must be used, as described above.
